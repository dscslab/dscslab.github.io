## Brief Biography
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). I 
obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Florida State University in 2016 and a MS in Computer Science from the same 
place in 2014. Prior to that I completed my undergraduate degree in Statistics from India. Prior to my current position, 
I was an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at UAH from 2018 and obtained promotion and tenure in 2023, two years 
earlier than the regular promotion and tenure cycle. Before joining UAH I was the CEO & Chief Scientist at Intelligent 
Robotics Inc., a non-profit research laboratory working for the United States Department of Defense projects. My 
research interests are broadly in the field of Machine Learning and AI with applications to Cyber Security, Digital and 
Mobile Forensics, Radio frequency Machine Learning, Remote Sensing, Network Centric Warfare and Assured Communications. 
I am also interested in Social Network Analysis, Cyber Law (Privacy and Security), Adversarial Machine Learning, real 
world problems in Computational Geometry, Graph Theory and Optimization. Most of my work have secondary applications in 
law enforcement and Military. More recently I have recently started working with Quantum Computation and Communication 
with specific interests in post quantum crypto and quantum machine learning with focus on classical-quantum interaction 
for obtaining real world speedups. My work has been funded through awards from several federal agencies like NASA, Air 
Force Research Laboratory, Army Research Laboratory, National Institute of Justice (under the Department of Justice 
programs) and has been featured many times in state and national media (both electronic and print). I received the UAH 
college of science Research Excellence Award in Spring 2022. In the past I have received multiple awards for teaching 
and academic excellence from Florida State University and University of Kalyani.
